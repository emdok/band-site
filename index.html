      <p>Dokken are an American metal band formed in 1979. They split up in 1989 and reformed four years later. They had three charting singles ("Alone Again", "In My Dreams" and "Burning Like a Flame") and have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide.Beast from the East was nominated for the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1989.[7]
      </p>
      <p>The classic Dokken line-up consisted of founder Don Dokken on vocals, George Lynch on lead guitar, Mick Brown on drums and Jeff Pilson, who replaced the Ratt-bound Juan Croucier in early 1984, on bass, This line-up remained stable from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1993 to 1997; only Dokken and Brown now remain. After several personnel changes on guitar, Dokken's attorney Jon Levin stepped in to fill the role in 2004. In 2001, Barry Sparks replaced Pilson on bass. In 2009, Sean McNabb (formerly with Great White and Quiet Riot) replaced him, and was then replaced by Chris McCarvill in 2015.</p>
